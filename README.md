# How to build this great project?

From anywhere (since cake is cool like that) simply run
    cake build

# How do I run this great project?
From the root directory, run 
    node lib/main.js

And the server will start running! Then navigate to wherever you hosted it on port 6543. For instance, if you run it on your local machine, go to <http://localhost:6543/>

Nothing else of note yet...
